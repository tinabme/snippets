A quick way to add row number to a resultset is to wrap the entire query as a sub query and add row_number in the outer query.

select *, row_number() over(order by (select 0)) as rn
from
  (  -- YOUR QUERY HERE
    select distinct -- your columns
    from YourTable
  ) as T

order by -- YOUR ORDER BY HERE
